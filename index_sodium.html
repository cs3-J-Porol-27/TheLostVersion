				        <h1> The Lost Version </h1>
						<h2> by: Joriz Zianne D. Porol </h2>
						<h3> As I drown myself in the plethora of emotions and oppositions </h3>
						<h3> I recall the permanent sepia hue that obscured my vision.</h3>
						<h3> The version of me that I once called my home, </h3>
						<h3> Gone, as I wait for the waves to swallow me whole.</h3>
						<h3> All the memories consume me, </h3>
						<h3> And the thoughts disipate from my reach. </h3>
						<h3> I find myself in a place where apathy was no longer, </h3>
						<h3> And I knew all I had to do was breathe. </h3>
